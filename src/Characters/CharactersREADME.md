All of the characters have 6 main abilities that come with the "roll", which mimics how a 6 sided die would operate. Some have "stacks", which are unique to the character and change some of their abilities/damage based on how many stacks that they have (and these stacks are also gained in ways unique to the character). Some characters also have a "7th ability" which is just what they do when they are finished channeling their ability (i.e. some abilities take a whole extra round to come to fruition). Characters also have status effects that end when they reach their turn again (like being stunned or slowed, but also good status effects like being sped up or shielded).
